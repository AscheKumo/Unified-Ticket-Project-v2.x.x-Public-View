# Unified Ticket Project v2.x.x Beta
A redesign and update to UTPv1

## Features:
- Redesigned to remove tabbed ticket creation between searching, issue, outage, and dispatch tickets.
- Initial account selection will populate all available fields, allowing for posting any ticket type from one page.
- Outage detection for faster outage ticket production.
- Posting dispatch tickets is more automated, perform full troubleshooting and when you go to post the ticket, select dispatch. Ticket will be posted, Dispatch created, and ticket queue will be changed over to TAC Repair Request.
- Ability to export and import tickets in the case of Sonar outages.
- Ticket categories will be included and post to the ticket.
- Ability to post the ticket normally, post a ticket without the initial body comment, submit only a comment to the body field, or submit and close the ticket.
- Personal notes inside the application, persistant between posting tickets.
- Other optimization improvements.
